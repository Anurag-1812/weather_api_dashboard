  <p><em>Interactive Weather Forecast Dashboard - Real-time data visualization for Indian cities</em></p>
</div>

## 📌 **Project Overview**
An interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes real-time weather forecasts and environmental conditions for major Indian cities using WeatherAPI integration. This comprehensive solution provides 7-day forecasts with hourly breakdowns, air quality monitoring, and UV index tracking.

## 🎯 **Objective**
Create a dynamic weather analytics platform that empowers farmers, travelers, city planners, and businesses to make data-driven decisions based on accurate weather forecasts and environmental conditions across multiple Indian metropolitan areas.

## 🔍 **Key Business Questions Addressed**
- **🌡️ Temperature Trends**: What are the daily and hourly temperature patterns across Noida, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Kolkata?
- **💨 Air Quality Insights**: How does air quality index (AQI) vary by city and time, and which areas have the highest pollution levels?
- **🌬️ Wind & Weather Patterns**: Which hours experience peak wind speeds, and how do weather conditions change throughout the day?
- **☀️ UV & Health Impact**: What are the UV index levels across different cities to help plan outdoor activities?
- **📊 Comparative Analysis**: How do weather conditions compare between major Indian cities for strategic planning?
- **🚜 Agricultural Planning**: How can accurate forecasts support farming decisions and crop management?

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**
The dashboard leverages parameterized queries with secure API key management, ensuring easy maintenance and updates. Custom DAX measures provide advanced analytics capabilities, while Power Query transformations handle complex JSON data structures from WeatherAPI endpoints.

### 🔑 **API Key Configuration**
```
**Note**: API keys may expire periodically. When updating, simply replace the parameter in Power Query Editor:
1. Go to **Data** > **Transform Data**
2. Navigate to **Manage Parameters**
3. Update the `API_Key` parameter with the new key
4. Refresh all queries

```

## 📈 **Future Enhancements**
- **🤖 Machine Learning Integration**: Predictive weather modeling
- **📧 Automated Alerts**: Email/SMS notifications for severe weather
- **🌍 Geographic Expansion**: Additional cities and international locations  
- **📱 Mobile App Integration**: Native mobile dashboard experience
- **🔗 IoT Sensor Integration**: Combine API data with local sensor readings
